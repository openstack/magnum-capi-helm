    csi_cinder_volume_binding_mode previously had no effect. If you use
    capi-helm-charts<0.8.0 then you would have set it to Immediate and since
    0.8.0 it has defaulted to WaitForFirstConsumer. The configuration is now
    being used, and we have set the default to match the new versions of the
    capi-helm-charts. However, if you have older clusters using a template
    with a very old capi-helm-chart, then really you need to keep the older
    default, to avoid a breakage on upgrade. This is specifically because
    the storage class, once created, is immutable.
