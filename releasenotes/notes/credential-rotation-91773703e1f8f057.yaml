features:
  - |
    Adds support for application credential rotation for workload clusters
    via the credential API.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes a bug where the application credential created for a cluster could
    persist after cluster deletion if the performing user did not have the
    correct privileges to delete it. This only applies to clusters using
    Keystone Ussuri or later due to a bug in earlier releases. See `LP#1901207
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1901207>`__
